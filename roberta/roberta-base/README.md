# Roberta-Base Model Directory

This directory contains the necessary files for utilizing the RoBERTa-base model for fine-tuning tasks.

## Contents

- `pytorch_model.bin`: The pre-trained model's weight file.
- `config.json`: The model configuration file.
- `tokenizer.json`: Configuration for the tokenizer.
- `vocab.json` and `merges.txt`: Tokenizer vocabulary files.

## Notes

You need to store the following files in this directory:

1. **`pytorch_model.bin`**: This file contains the model's weights, which are used during fine-tuning and inference.
2. **`config.json`**: This configuration file defines the model's architecture and hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden size, and attention heads.
3. **`tokenizer.json`**: Specifies tokenizer configurations, including tokenization rules and encoding methods.
4. **`vocab.json`** and **`merges.txt`**: These files define the tokenizer's vocabulary and merge operations for byte pair encoding (BPE).
