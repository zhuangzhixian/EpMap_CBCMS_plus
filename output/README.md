# Output Directory

This directory is used to store the results generated during the model fine-tuning process, including the fine-tuned model parameters.

## Important Notes
1. Ensure sufficient disk space is available before running the training process, as this directory may store multiple artifacts for each training run.
2. Periodically clean the directory by removing old or unused files to optimize storage management.
3. Always backup critical files, such as the best-performing model weights, for reuse or deployment.
